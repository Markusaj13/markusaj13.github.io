              <h2>SERW - Connecting the elderly and reducing loneliness</h2>
              <p>
              <h3>About this project</h3>
              SERW is a newly founded company who aim to reduce loneliness among the elderly by offering a variety of
              free events like lunches or museum visits. <br>
              However during 2020, as Covid-19 hit the world, Serw needed a new way to get the elderly to interact more
              with the website as social events were heavily restricted. <br>
              Patrik Larsson, founder of serw.se, reached out to our school in search of a capable UX-team to help them
              move their company in the right direction. <br>
              After a quick review of their website, especially the mobile version, my team decided that we wanted to
              help as we felt we could really make a change for this company.
              <br><br>

              <h3>The goal</h3>
              <strong>The key goal</strong> Was to design a user-friendly website alternative based on user research
              <br>
              Our job would be to redesign the website to make it more accessible as the company now needed to rely more
              heavily on web-based events and activities than before. In addition to this, our team took it upon
              ourselves to create our own, separate goal. We created a completely new service for the website along with
              the new design, to give the company a better idea of what they needed to focus on design wise in the
              future.

              The new service was <strong>Forums</strong>. <br>
              Based on previous research by the company, most users were using mobile devices to browse serw.se so we
              chose to design our project using “<strong>mobile first</strong>” thinking. <br><br>

              <h3>The challenge</h3>
              The biggest challenge was making the website design as accessible as possible to the target audience,
              people over the age of 65, and taking into account the extensive amount of criteria needed to fulfill WCAG
              standards. <br>
              Another great challenge of ours was reaching out to the target audience during Covid-19 to conduct
              surveys, interviews, and usability tests. We instead had to rely on digital surveys and testing which
              eventually proved reliable as well. <br><br>

              <h3>The process and solution</h3>
              <h5>User research – Understanding the user</h5>
              To understand the user, we created a survey to define the target audience’s digital habits. We felt that a
              survey by e-mail was the best way to reach a large amount of people, especially in the time of Covid-19.
              We then compiled and presented the results to the customer who based on the answers had follow up
              questions he wanted answered. We iterated and created a new survey from which we got a lot more
              information <br>
              After a lot of data collection, however helpless the elderly first seemed, research showed that a larger
              percent of the people we surveyed and interviewed were a lot more tech-savvy than we first anticipated as
              many of them were active on social platforms like Instagram and Facebook.
              However their willingness to try new things on the internet were not as high as we would have liked.
              <br><br>
              <h5>Empathize/Define/Ideate</h5>
              From these interviews we were able to create an accurate <strong>persona</strong> and a believable
              <strong>problem statement</strong> which we could use as a solid starting point for our project. We also
              created <strong>mood boards</strong> to help us get the feeling of the direction we were headed, an
              <strong>effect-map</strong> to get a clear idea of what steps we needed to take to achieve our goal, a
              <strong>mindmap</strong>, derived from a board of post-it notes, of our ideas for the best user experience
              of the website and a <strong>Sitemaps</strong> to give ourselves a structured blueprint from which to
              start building the website! <br><br>
              <h5>Prototyping</h5>
              At this stage we started sketching and later testing our lo-fi wireframes. We tested and compared the
              results to all our documentations and proceeded to <strong>iterate</strong> until we felt the lo-fi
              wireframes were ready to be upgraded to a hi-fi prototype. We preformed <strong>usability tests</strong>
              and <strong>iterated</strong> the prototype until we reached our final product! <br><br>


              <h3>My Contribution</h3>
              All the team worked closely together on the same areas throughout the project effectively taking on the
              same roles as UX-Researchers/UX-Designers/Web designers. However, naturally we gravitate towards our
              strengths. <br>
              One of my strengths being my sense of detail and organizing, I took on the responsibility of structuring
              our work as the project went on. I created and structured all our folders, documents, and surveys in
              Google Drive and Canva and Mailchimp which proved most useful for finalizing data for the conclusive
              presentation of the project. <br>
              Another of my strengths during the project was the prototyping tool Figma. Because of this I took on the
              roll as the main organizer, in charge of maintaining and coordinating the prototype. <br>
              My experience from a previous project and ability to learn quickly gave me the skills and to teach my
              fellow classmates more about ‘Figma’, which is something I love to do. <br>
              I love to learn new things, but if I can teach one person one thing, especially something I am passionate
              about, that has been a good day! <br><br>


              <h3>The results</h3>
              We created better, more complete phone adapted webpage design with high accessibility and a sleek design.
              <br>
              We received a very satisfied customer who will use our new template as a guide to develop the rest of the
              website. <br><br>
              <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
              <strong>Research</strong>: This was the first time I focused so heavily on user research in a project, and
              I learned a lot about how valuable user research is on the path to understanding the users needs and
              desires! <br>
              <strong>Live case</strong>: This was my first real world project where I actually had a customer relying
              on me and my team. This one of the greatest learning experiences! <br>
              <strong>Connect</strong>: I realized that I am not bothering the customer by asking questions. The
              customer wants to be involved and is often happy to give inputs. Don’t be afraid to reach out to the
              customer! <br>
              <strong>Kill your darlings</strong>: Sometimes you must accept that you need to drop parts of your idea
              and compromise! Try combining it with your teammates idea instead and a third teammate might se the hidden
              gold nugget within your combined efforts! <br>
              <strong>Team work</strong>: Take advantage of the team and each individuals strengths and learn to discuss
              with my team what is important to focus on at the moment and what is not. <br>
              <br><br>
